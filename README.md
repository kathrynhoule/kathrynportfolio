# kathrynportfolio

## Phase 1
Phase 1 of this project will be to create a basic portfolio website for linking to my work and projects, as well as talking a bit about myself. The goal is for this phase to be simple and straightforward, with items that I can easily add and adjust later on when I have more to add to this.

## Phase 2
Phase 2 of this project will be for making the portfolio more responsive if anything was missed in Phase 1, adding in my own images and files to replace any placeholders from Phase 1, and adding in any additional animations or general styling.

## Phase 3
This final phase will be for adjusting the styling or anything else based on feedback from peers and any final adjustments I would personally like to make.
