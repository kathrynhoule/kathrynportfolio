# kathrynportfolio

## Phase 1
Phase 1 of this project will be to create a basic portfolio website for linking to my work and projects, as well as talking a bit about myself. The goal is for this phase to be simple and straightforward, with items that I can easily add and adjust later on when I have more to add to this.

## Phase 2
Phase 2 of this project will be for making the portfolio responsive, and adding in any of my own images and files to replace any placeholders from Phase 1.

## Phase 3
This final phase will be for adjusting the styling or anything else based on feedback from peers and any final adjustments I would personally like to make.
